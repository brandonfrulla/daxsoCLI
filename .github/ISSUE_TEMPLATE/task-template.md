Here's a template guide that aligns with what we are going for with this project. We want to be able to handle most frameworks and blockchains in the future which is huge scope so it's important to get everyone on the same page now.

# Issue and Task Guide for GitHub Issues

### Introduction

When creating new issues or tasks on GitHub, it's important to provide detailed information to ensure that contributors can understand and address the issue effectively. The following guide outlines the structure that issues and tasks should follow to ensure clarity and productivity.

## Issue Creation

### Title
The title should be concise and descriptive of the issue at hand.

### Description
Include a detailed description of the issue, providing as much information as necessary to convey the problem fully. It should cover:
1. Background of the issue.
2. The exact problem or requirement.
3. The proposed solution or suggested approach to solve it.

### Labels
Utilize labels to categorize the issue effectively (e.g., bug, enhancement, good first issue, etc.).

### Assignees
Assign the issue to relevant team members or leave it unassigned for anyone interested to take up.

## Task Creation

Each task created should contain the following sections:

### Specifications
Detail the specifications that the solution should adhere to.

### Scope Estimation/Time Boxing (Optional for External Contributors)
Estimate the scope of the task in terms of complexity and effort required, using a scale of:
- Minutes
- Hours
- Days
- Weeks
- Months
- Years

### Dependencies
List any dependencies that this task relies on, including other tasks or resources. This section could also be used to discuss possible blocks or reasoning for delaying a feature.

## Definition of Done

Define the criteria that must be met for the task to be considered complete. This could include:
1. Code completion.
2. Code reviewed and approved by peers.
3. Passing all unit and integration tests.
4. Documentation updated.
5. Merged to the main branch.

### Name of Branch
Create a name for the branch/task so it can be tracked coherently across branches and forks if the need arises. Follow a Jira inspired naming convention
```bash
DAX-[Short_Desciptor]-[IssueNumber]
```
