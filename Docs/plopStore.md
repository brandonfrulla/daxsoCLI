# Redux and Plop

It looks like you are trying to import the `responseData` object and `handleResponseChange` function from a custom Redux store into a Plop.js generator. Plop.js doesn't have direct access to your Redux store because it's a separate tool that runs in the command line.

Let's correct your approach by adjusting the structure of the code:

Firstly, you need to understand that you can't import the Redux store directly to Plop. This is because Plop doesn't have direct access to your Redux store. Plop is a separate tool used for generating boilerplate code, and doesn't have access to runtime state data unless it is passed in explicitly.

Instead, you can create a JSON file that stores your Redux state. Then, in your Plopfile.js, you can read from that JSON file, and use the data to guide your generation process. You already have a function that writes the Redux state to a JSON file in your store implementation (`writeToFile`), but you aren't using it currently. You may want to use it in `handleResponseChange` function.

Here's how to modify your store implementation:

```javascript
// ...

// Define the callback function that will be called when the response changes
export const handleResponseChange = ( data: ResponseData ) => {
  // Check if all questions have been answered
  if ( data && Object.keys( data ).length === questionFunctions.length ) {
    // Write the response data to file
    writeToFile(data);
  }
};
//...
```

Then in your Plop file, you can read from the generated JSON file:

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import { NodePlopAPI } from 'plop';

export default function (plop: NodePlopAPI) {
  // Retrieve data from the JSON file
  const responseData = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('response.json', 'utf-8'));

  // Rest of your code...
}
```

Now, the Plop file will have access to the most recent state from your Redux store when it runs. However, please note that you'll need to ensure that your Redux store has been updated and the JSON file has been written before running your Plop generator.

Keep in mind that this is a workaround solution as Plop is not designed to access runtime state from a Redux store directly. You may want to consider if Plop is the right tool for your needs if you require accessing and manipulating runtime state frequently.
