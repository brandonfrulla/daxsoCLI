The **Developer Acceleration eXperience for Smart-contract Organizations** was created to address the challenges and limitations facing developers in the Web3 ecosystem. As someone deeply passionate about the developer experience, I recognized that despite the rapid growth and interest in Web3 projects in 2020, the state of the community was still far behind Web2 in terms of accessibility, usability, and available frameworks for JavaScript developers.

## Journey

My journey into Web3 began after a deep dive into Next.js and building close connections with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home), Theo, and Alex. As I began to carve out my niche in building the JavaScript pieces for new projects, I found myself constantly switching between different repos, tools, and even entire developer environments just to build the simplest demos and client projects.

## Fixable Problems

To address this fragmentation and lack of coherence, the **Developer Acceleration eXperience for Smart-contract Organizations** provides a comprehensive toolkit that streamlines the development process. With a single set of command-line interface (CLI) tools, developers can install, build, test, manage, and deploy entire projects from start to finish. This toolkit aims to eliminate the pain points and difficulties associated with spinning up new projects quickly and effectively.

### Consensys Solutions

The toolkit leverages the tools and resources offered by Consensys, a leading blockchain technology company, to provide next-generation Web3 tools that are both accessible and easy to use. The goal is to create a more seamless and intuitive development experience for Web3 developers, making it easier and faster to build and deploy smart contracts.

For those interested in using Consensys products, the Developer Acceleration eXperience for Smart-contract Organizations is an excellent place to start. And for those curious about the specific technology choices made, we provide comprehensive documentation and support resources to help developers navigate the complexities of the Web3 ecosystem.
