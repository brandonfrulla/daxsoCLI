In the initial phase of the DAXSO project, we leveraged the well-established OpenZeppelin contracts to streamline the early development process and to secure the foundation of our platform. OpenZeppelin contracts are renowned for their security and robustness, providing a reliable basis for a wide array of blockchain projects. However, as DAXSO continues to evolve, our vision extends far beyond the current implementation. We are actively working on expanding the capabilities of our platform to support a diverse range of smart contract types, fostering an inclusive and dynamic ecosystem that can cater to the varied needs and preferences of the developer community.

## Advancing Towards Automation

To facilitate a smoother and more intuitive deployment process, our dedicated team is focused on developing a sophisticated CLI (Command Line Interface) tool that will be capable of auto-detecting the kind of smart contract being imported. This utility aims to simplify the deployment process considerably by generating the requisite files automatically, thus removing the necessity for manual configuration and reducing the potential for errors.

The goal here is not just to enhance the efficiency but also to make the DAXSO platform more accessible to developers with different levels of expertise. By automating mundane tasks, developers can channel their energies into building innovative features and optimizing their contracts, thereby accelerating the overall development cycle.

## Multi-Contract Support

Our aspirations for the DAXSO project are grounded in the belief that versatility fosters innovation. By opening up support for various types of contracts, we are paving the way for a multi-faceted development environment where diverse ideas can come to fruition. In the near future, DAXSO will be equipped to handle contracts of varying complexities and functionalities, ranging from simple tokens to intricate decentralized applications.

Our team is also committed to constantly updating the CLI tool to keep pace with the rapidly changing landscape of blockchain technology. This means that as new types of contracts emerge, our tool will be updated to detect and facilitate their deployment, ensuring that DAXSO remains at the forefront of technological advancement.

## Looking Forward

As we advance in this journey, we remain committed to our mission of fostering a vibrant and inclusive developer ecosystem. Through the continuous refinement of our CLI tool, we aim to streamline the deployment process, thereby lowering the barrier to entry and encouraging a greater diversity of developers to participate in the blockchain revolution.

We invite you to join us on this exciting journey as we work towards realizing our vision for a dynamic, automated, and inclusive DAXSO platform that stands as a beacon of innovation and collaboration in the blockchain space.
